            <p>Back in the day when smartphones first started taking over, they werenâ€™t as snappy as we expect them to be today. I remember when I got a small android phone from Sony. I was obsessed with the OS immediately but was frustrated with the performance and noticing areas where the UX was lacking. I learnt to root for superuser access to system level directories. I could then flash customs ROMs and kernels to tune the UI and performance to my liking. I believe this is when my unquenchable appreciation for technology started. Now, I am graduating with a B.S. in Applied Math and Computer Science and on my way to to enter the industry head first.
